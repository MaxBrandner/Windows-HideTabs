# Windows-HideTabs

Prerequisites: +++ <a href="https://www.autohotkey.com/" title="Autohotkey v1">Autohotkey v1</a> +++

## General

This script minimizes windows to a menu in the system tray. This hides it from the Alt+Tab list and Taskbar. But it's still running in the background. You can use this script to hide away windows without having to open a different virtual desktop or closing them.

## Usage

### Keyboard Shortcut

`Ctrl + Alt + H` - Minimize current window to tray

*Each minimized window gets its own menu entry,*

### Right-Click Main Icon (AHK) in System Tray

- **Restore All Windows** - Restores all minimized windows at once
- **Help** - Displays a help message
- **Exit** - Closes the script and restores all windows
- **List of all minimized windows** - Shows all currently minimized windows

#### Each Minimized Window Entry in the List

- **Restore** - Restores the selected window
- **Close** - Closes the selected window

## Technical
The script uses `WinHide` to hide windows and tracks them for restoration.
